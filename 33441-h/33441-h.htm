(Pope, Epistle to Burlington)
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
The idea of "taste" and the ideal of the "man of taste" have fallen considerably in critical esteem since the eighteenth century. When F. R. Leavis calls Andrew Lang "a scholar and a man of taste, with a feeling for language and a desire to write poetry,"[1] it is clear that for Leavis these attributes disqualify Lang from being taken seriously as a poet. But for the age of Pope, "taste" was a key term in its aesthetic thinking; the meaning and application of the term was a lively issue which engaged most of the ablest minds of the period.
</p>
<p>
Addison prefaced his series of Spectator papers on the "Pleasures of the Imagination" with a ground-clearing essay on "taste" (No. 409). In this classic account of the term, Addison defines "taste" as "that Faculty of the Soul, which discerns the Beauties of an Author with Pleasure, and the Imperfections with Dislike." Addison's "taste" is an innate proclivity towards certain kinds of aesthetic experience that has been consciously cultivated in the approved direction. It is not enough to value and enjoy the right authors; they must be valued and enjoyed for the right reasons. When he holds up to ridicule the man who assured him that "the greatest Pleasure he took in reading Virgil, was in examining Aeneas his Voyage by the Map," Addison clearly expects his readers to agree that such a singular taste was in fact no taste at all. His account implies not only a standard of "taste," but also general agreement, at least among "men of taste," about what the standard was. It is this circularity that makes it essential to assume some innate faculty of "taste."
</p>
<p>
But Addison's prescription for the cultivation of taste was a laborious one, involving prolonged reading and study. The wealthy, and especially the newly wealthy, were tempted to confuse the correct appreciation of the objects of taste with the mere possession of them; so that, as with Pope's Timon in the
<i>
Epistle to Burlington
</i>
(1731), owning a library became a substitute for reading books. This false taste for ostentation&#8212;especially in buildings&#8212;is a frequent target of contemporary satire.
</p>
<p>
The social importance of "taste" as an index of wealth was reinforced by current philosophical thinking that gave "taste" a moral dimension too. In his
<i>
Characteristicks
</i>
(1711), Shaftesbury postulated an innate moral sense, just as Addison did an innate aesthetic sense. Shaftesbury draws this analogy between the moral and the aesthetic:
</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>
The Case is the same here [in the mental or moral Subjects], as in the ordinary Bodys, or common Subjects of Sense. The Shapes, Motions, Colours, and Proportions of these being presented to our Eye; there necessarily results a Beauty or Deformity, according to the different Measure, Arrangement and Disposition of their several Parts. So in
<i>
Behaviour
</i>
and
<i>
Actions</i>, when presented to our Understanding, there must be found, of necessity, an apparent Difference, according to the Regularity or Irregularity of the Subjects.[2]
</p>
</div>
<p>
The correct training of this capacity would enable men to make the right choices in both moral and aesthetic matters. This analogy is also the basis of Francis Hutcheson's
<i>
Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections
</i>
(1728).
</p>
<p>
It is against the philosophical background of the writings of Addison, Shaftesbury, and Hutcheson that the satire on "taste" of Pope, Bramston, and others must be seen. But by the time Pope wrote his
<i>
Epistle to Burlington</i>, Addison's "Faculty of the Soul" had been somewhat debased as a critical term, and the decline of "taste" was a common topic. "Nothing is so common as the affectation of, nor any thing so seldom found as Taste" was the complaint of the
<i>
Weekly Register
</i>
in 1731, deploring "the degeneracy of
<i>
Taste
</i>
since Mr.
<i>
Addison's
</i>
time."[3]
</p>
<p>
The publication of Pope's
<i>
Epistle to Burlington
</i>
in December 1731 was a literary event of some importance, especially since it was his first poem since the
<i>
Dunciad Variorum
</i>
of 1729. The
<i>
Epistle
</i>
gave "taste" a renewed currency as a vogue word. "Of Taste" is found only on the half-title of the first edition. But, significantly changed to "Of False Taste" for the second edition, this designation found its way onto the title-page of the third edition, and became the poem's popular title (it is so described on the advertisement leaf of Bramston's
<i>
The Man of Taste</i>).
</p>
<p>
Several attacks on Pope and his poem were published in the following year or so.
<i>
A Miscellany on Taste
</i>
(1732) reprinted Pope's
<i>
Epistle
</i>
with combative critical notes. Pope himself was attacked, as "Mr. Alexander Taste," in an anonymous pamphlet
<i>
Mr. Taste the Poetical Fop
</i>
(1732), reissued in 1733 as
<i>
The Man of Taste</i>, apparently borrowing the title of Bramston's poem.[4] Bramston's
<i>
The Man of Taste
</i>
(1733) is an early example of the more positive reaction to Pope's
<i>
Epistle</i>, joining him rather than attempting to beat him. Bramston's poem in its turn occasioned an anonymous
<i>
The Woman of Taste
</i>
(1733), and suggested some details for the character of Lord Apemode in James Miller's comedy
<i>
The Man of Taste
</i>
(1735). Pope himself borrowed an idea from it (see p. 14, 11. 5-6) for a passage in the
<i>
Dunciad
</i>
(the allusion to Free-Masons and F.R.S.; IV, 567-71).
</p>
<p>
The cluster of works provoked by Pope's
<i>
Epistle
</i>
is evidence of the topicality of "taste" at the time Bramston wrote his poem, and it is his
<i>
Man of Taste
</i>
that retains most interest today. The later history of "taste" in eighteenth-century aesthetics and satire can only briefly be glanced at here. Important philosophical discussions are Hume's essay "Of the Standard of Taste" (in Four Dissertations, 1757), Burke's
<i>
Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful
</i>
(1757; a "Discourse Concerning Taste" was prefaced to the second edition, 1759), and Alexander Gerard's
<i>
Essay on Taste
</i>
(1759). Foote's farce
<i>
Taste
</i>
(1752) exposed the sham taste for the antique. There are numerous satiric portraits of the "Man of Taste": Mr. Sterling in
<i>
The Clandestine Marriage
</i>
(1766) is a good example clearly in the tradition of Pope's Timon, as is General Tilney in
<i>
Northanger Abbey
</i>
(1818, but written much earlier).
</p>
<p>
By the time of Jane Austen, of course, "taste" had developed away from the Addisonian rules, and indeed the whole tenor of the aesthetics of the imagination had changed. What had happened can be suggested by juxtaposing two significant statements about "taste" as metaphor. In his
<i>
Spectator
</i>
essay (No. 409) Addison speaks of "a very great Conformity between that Mental Taste, which is the Subject of this Paper, and that Sensitive Taste which gives us a Relish of every different Flavour that affects the Palate." But in the Preface to
<i>
Lyrical Ballads
</i>
(1802), Wordsworth deprecates those "who will converse with us as gravely about a
<i>
taste
</i>
for Poetry, as they express it, as if it were a thing indifferent as a taste for Rope-dancing, or Frontiniac or Sherry."[5] But the breakdown of the metaphor of "taste" is too large a subject to be explored here.
</p>
<hr class="short">
<p>
James Bramston (?1694-1743) was educated at Westminster School and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he took his B.A. in 1717 and his M.A. in 1720. He took orders, and was for a time a military chaplain. In 1724 he obtained the living of Lurgashall, and in 1739 those of Harting and Westhampnett.[6] He published (all anonymously) only three poems in English:
</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>
1.
<i>
The Art of Politicks, in Imitation of Horace's Art of Poetry.
</i>
London: Lawton Gilliver, 1729.
</p>
<p>
2.
<i>
The Man of Taste. Occasion'd by an Epistle of Mr. Pope's on that Subject.
</i>
London: Lawton Gilliver, 1733.
</p>
<p>
3.
<i>
The Crooked Six-pence. With a Learned Preface Found among Some Papers Bearing Date the Same Year in which Paradise Lost Was Published by the Late Dr. Bently.
</i>
London: Robert Dodsley, 1743.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Bramston also wrote Latin verses, and at least two unpublished poems survive; but his reputation rests on
<i>
The Art of Politicks
</i>
and
<i>
The Man of Taste</i>. Both poems are of interest to the political and cultural historian, but from a literary point of view
<i>
The Man of Taste
</i>
is probably the better poem. This is largely because of Bramston's success in creating the persona of a self-consciously affected Man of Taste, who, however, exposes himself more than he intends. Joseph Warton mistook this effect for a failure of technique when he called Bramston "guilty of the indecorum and absurdity of making his hero laugh at himself and his own follies."[7] The poem is deliberately the "confessions" of a self-styled Man of Taste. It begins in a casual, cynical tone, but as the speaker is gradually seduced by his own rhetoric (especially when he imagines himself a nobleman) he strikes an almost rhapsodic note, so that he is revealed as the victim, not the exploiter, of "taste."
</p>
<p>
Both in his targets and his techniques, Bramston is a disciple of Pope. Sometimes there is a conscious recollection of the master:
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I squal'd in Distichs, and in Triplets wept. (p. 6)
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Elsewhere the imitation is less happy:
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Sure wretched
<i>
Wren
</i>
was taught by bungling
<i>
Jones</i>,
</p>
<p>
To murder mortar, and disfigure stones! (p. 10)
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Here the stylistic habit of antithesis works against the meaning instead of reinforcing it. But there are many good things in the poem; Bramston's treatment of the idea of the stage as a "school of morality," for example, is clever and amusing. His hero derives his "Hereditary Taste" from being "tragi-comically got" by a player-poet and an orange-woman (p. 6). This gives point to his later claim:
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
<i>
Oxford
</i>
and
<i>
Cambridge
</i>
are not worth one farthing,
</p>
<p>
Compar'd to
<i>
Haymarket</i>, and
<i>
Convent-garden</i>:
</p>
<p>
Quit those, ye British Youth, and follow these,
</p>
<p>
Turn players all, and take your Squires degrees. (p. 18)
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
There are also a number of verbal successes, such as:
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Nor barb'rous birch e'er brush'd my brawny bum. (p. 6)
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Here insistent alliteration and strong rhythm are combined to excellent onomatopoeic effect. Another couplet:
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Tho'
<i>
Blackmore's
</i>
works my soul with raptures fill,
</p>
<p>
With notes by
<i>
Bently
</i>
they'd be better still. (p. 7)
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
shows considerable appreciation of the Art of Sinking; the second line especially is fine bathos.
</p>
<p>
The poem as a whole provides an interesting portrait of contemporary fashionable "taste" that supplements, at a lower social level, Pope's portraits of such magnates of tastelessness as Timon. Bramston's Man of Taste is an odd amalgam of the singular and the trite. He begins by professing to despise laws, and ends by attempting to enact his own. In drawing a character whose tastes are at one moment shamelessly perverse, at another servilely imitative, and in depicting a wide range of "tastes," Bramston has developed significantly the idea that he took from the
<i>
Epistle to Burlington</i>, which is largely concerned with false taste in building.
</p>
<p>
This is not to deny that most of the victims of Bramston's satire are somewhere Pope's too. At times one even begins to suspect that Bramston's knowledge of London derives as much from the
<i>
Dunciad Variorum
</i>
as from first-hand experience of the city. There is certainly a strong traditional element in some of his themes. The ironic praise of Sir Cloudesley Shovell's tomb, for example (p. 12), was probably suggested by the
<i>
Spectator
</i>
(No. 26) rather than a visit to Westminster Abbey; the tomb had offended Addison because it portrayed the admiral in an alien character.
</p>
<p>
But the traditional is combined with the topical. If Sir Cloudesley's tomb had been a butt for twenty years, Sir Balaam is an allusion to Pope's
<i>
Epistle to Bathurst</i>, only published in February, 1733, the month before the
<i>
Man of Taste</i>. Further evidence that Bramston was making additions to the poem as late as February 1733 (the poem was published on 8 March) are the lines:
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Not so my mind, unsatisfied with hints,
</p>
<p>
Knows more than
<i>
Budgel
</i>
writes, or
<i>
Roberts
</i>
prints. (p. 10)
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
These lines hit at a new readers' digest,
<i>
The Bee: or, Universal Weekly Pamphlet. Containing Something to Hit Every Man's Taste and Principles</i>, which was edited by Budgell and published by Roberts. The first number came out in February 1733. There is a similar mixture of past and current with the musical satire (p. 13). Handel's
<i>
Esther
</i>
and the novelty of oratorio were as recent as 1732; Heidegger's ugliness ("Prince
<i>
Phyz</i>!") was proverbial, and his renaming of the masquerade a decade old.
</p>
<p>
This mixture is confusing, but certainly intentional, since it would have made the
<i>
Man of Taste
</i>
more ridiculous to a contemporary audience. There is also a vertical mixture of the tastes of different levels of society; the writer in the
<i>
Weekly Register
</i>
for February 1731, already quoted above, makes this distinction: "The gaming-table, and the royal diversion at
<i>
Newmarket</i>, are the ambition of the majority; and the rest prefer
<i>
Senesino
</i>
to
<i>
Shakespear</i>, as the highest proof of modern politeness."[8] Bramston's Man of Taste is a concertina-brow, enjoying Senesino, gaming, and Newmarket (pp. 13, 15, 17).
</p>
<p>
The usefulness of notes for a full understanding of Bramston's satire was recognized as early as 1733, when a few were added to Faulkner's Dublin reprint. Faulkner's notes are remarkable for their xenophobic bias, for apart from those on Mrs. Oldfield ("<i>Ophelia</i>," p. 9), they mostly call attention to evils of continental origin: Pasaran's recommendation of suicide (p. 9); Heidegger's role as corrupting entertainer (p. 13); the imposter Count D'Ughi (the "<i>Di'mond Count</i>," p. 16); and Misaubin (p. 17), "famous for curing the venereal Disorders." These men were Italian, Swiss, Italian, and French respectively. This xenophobia is a remarkably constant feature of eighteenth-century satire on "taste."
</p>
<p>
<i>
The Man of Taste
</i>
(together with
<i>
The Art of Politicks</i>) was included in Dodsley's
<i>
Collection</i>; in the 1782 edition, notes (unsigned, but by Isaac Reed) were added, identifying many allusions which no longer passed current. These are often helpful, but sometimes miss the point&#8212;as they do with the Budgell-Roberts joke, discussed above. But although notes are useful for a complete understanding of all Bramston's satiric points, a familiarity with the world of Pope and his victims removes most of the difficulties for a modern reader. Only occasionally does Bramston sound a more personal note, as in the list of doctors (p. 17), where he includes two of his contemporaries at Christ Church; and even here, Arbuthnot is a sufficient signpost.
</p>
<p>
Bramston is a minor poet, but there is no need to apologize for
<i>
The Man of Taste</i>. It is a lively and amusing poem in its own right, and its association with Pope and its place in the corpus of eighteenth-century satire on "taste" raise its claim to the attention of students of the period.

A Note on the Text
</p>
<p>
<i>
The Man of Taste
</i>
was published on 8 March 1733 by Lawton Gilliver in a handsome folio format. A second folio edition (although not so called) was published later in the same month; this was followed within the year by octavo editions in London
<a href="#note1" name="noteref1">
<span class="fnlabel">
<sup>

</a>
and Dublin.
</p>
<p>
Using the evidence of advertisements in the two folios and contemporary newspapers, W. B. Todd argues for the priority of the edition he calls "A,"
<a href="#note2" name="noteref2">
<span class="fnlabel">
<sup>

</a>
reversing the order previously suggested by Iolo A. Williams on internal evidence.
<a href="#note3" name="noteref3">
<span class="fnlabel">
<sup>
3</sup></span>
</a>
The textual variants are slight and are confined to accidentals, except that on p. 5, line 9, "A" reads "Strife still persists" and "B" has "Strife still subsists." A copy of Todd's edition "A" is reproduced here.

hoe'er</span> he be that to a
<i>
Taste

aspires,
</p>
<p>
Let him read this, and be what he desires.
</p>
<p>
In men and manners vers'd from life I write,
</p>
<p>
Not what was once but what is now polite.
</p>
<p>
Those who of courtly
<i>
France
</i>
have made the tour,
</p>
<p>
Can scarce our
<i>
English
</i>
awkwardness endure.
</p>
<p>
But honest men who never were abroad,
</p>
<p>
Like
<i>
England
</i>
only, and its
<i>
Taste
</i>
applaud.
</p>
<p>
Strife still persists, which yields the better
<i>
go&#251;t</i>;
</p>
<p>
Books or the world, the many or the few.
</p>
<p class="i2">
True
<i>
Taste
</i>
to me is by this touchstone known,
</p>
<p>
That's always best that's nearest to my own.
</p>
<p>
To shew that my pretensions are not vain,
</p>
<p>
My Father was a play'r in
<i>
Drury-lane</i>.
</p>
<p>
Pears and Pistachio-nuts my Mother sold,
</p>
<p>
He a Dramatick-poet, She a Scold.
</p>
<p>
His tragick muse could Countesses affright,
</p>
<p>
Her wit in boxes was my Lord's delight.
</p>
<p>
No mercenary
<i>
Priest
</i>
e'er join'd their hands,
</p>
<p>
Uncramp'd by wedlock's unpoetick bands.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Laws
</i>
my Pindarick parents matter'd not,
</p>
<p>
So I was tragi-comically got.
</p>
<p>
My infant tears a sort of measure kept,
</p>
<p>
I squal'd in Distichs, and in Triplets wept.
</p>
<p>
No youth did in I education waste,
</p>
<p>
Happy in an
<i>
Hereditary Taste</i>.
</p>
<p>
Writing ne'er cramp'd the sinews of my thumb,
</p>
<p>
Nor barb'rous birch e'er brush'd my brawny bum.
</p>
<p>
My guts ne'er suffer'd from a college-cook,
</p>
<p>
My name ne'er enter'd in a buttery-book.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Grammar
</i>
in vain the sons of
<i>
Priscian
</i>
teach,
</p>
<p>
Good Parts are better than
<i>
Eight Parts of Speech</i>:
</p>
<p>
Since these declin'd those undeclin'd they call,
</p>
<p>
I thank my Stars, that I declin'd 'em all.
</p>
<p>
To
<i>
Greek
</i>
or
<i>
Latin Tongues
</i>
without pretence,
</p>
<p>
I trust to mother Wit, and father Sense.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Nature</i>'s my guide, all Sciences I scorn,
</p>
<p>
Pains I abhor, I was a
<i>
Poet born</i>.
</p>
<p class="i2">
Yet is my
<i>
go&#251;t
</i>
for criticism such,
</p>
<p>
I've got some
<i>
French</i>, and know a little
<i>
Dutch</i>.
</p>
<p>
Huge commentators grace my learned shelves,
</p>
<p>
Notes upon books out-do the books themselves.
</p>
<p>
Criticks indeed are valuable men,
</p>
<p>
But hyper-criticks are as good agen.
</p>
<p>
Tho'
<i>
Blackmore</i>'s works my soul with raptures fill,
</p>
<p>
With notes by
<i>
Bently
</i>
they'd be better still.
</p>
<p>
The
<i>
Boghouse-Miscellany</i>'s well design'd,
</p>
<p>
To ease the body, and improve the mind.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Swift</i>'s whims and jokes for my resentment call,
</p>
<p>
For he displeases me, that pleases all.
</p>
<p>
Verse without rhyme I never could endure,
</p>
<p>
Uncouth in numbers, and in sense obscure.
</p>
<p>
To him as Nature, when he ceas'd to see,
</p>
<p>
<i>
Milton</i>'s an
<i>
universal Blank
</i>
to me.
</p>
<p>
Confirm'd and settled by the Nations voice,
</p>
<p>
Rhyme is the poet's pride, and peoples choice.
</p>
<p>
Always upheld by national Support,
</p>
<p>
Of Market, University, and Court:
</p>
<p>
<i>
Thompson</i>, write blank; but know that for that reason,
</p>
<p>
These lines shall live, when thine are out of season.
</p>
<p>
Rhyme binds and beautifies the Poet's lays,
</p>
<p>
As
<i>
London
</i>
Ladies owe their shape to stays.
</p>
<p class="i2">
Had
<i>
Cibber</i>'s self the
<i>
Careless Husband
</i>
wrote,
</p>
<p>
He for the Laurel ne'er had had my Vote:
</p>
<p>
But for his Epilogues and other Plays,
</p>
<p>
He thoroughly deserves the
<i>
Modern Bays</i>.
</p>
<p>
It pleases me, that
<i>
Pope
</i>
unlaurell'd goes,
</p>
<p>
While
<i>
Cibber
</i>
wears the Bays for Playhouse Prose.
</p>
<p>
So
<i>
Britain</i>'s Monarch once uncover'd fate,
</p>
<p>
While
<i>
Bradshaw
</i>
bully'd in a broad-brimm'd hat.
</p>
<p class="i2">
Long live old
<i>
Curl!
</i>
he ne'er to publish fears,
</p>
<p>
The speeches, verses, and last wills of Peers.
</p>
<p>
How oft has he a publick spirit shewn,
</p>
<p>
And pleas'd our ears regardless of his own?
</p>
<p>
But to give Merit due, though
<i>
Curl</i>'s the same?
</p>
<p>
Are not his Brother-booksellers the same?
</p>
<p>
Can Statutes keep the
<i>
British
</i>
Press in awe,
</p>
<p>
While that sells best, that's most against the Law?
</p>
<p class="i2">
<i>
Lives
</i>
of dead
<i>
Play'rs
</i>
my leisure hours beguile,
</p>
<p>
And
<i>
Sessions-Papers
</i>
tragedize my stile.
</p>
<p>
'Tis charming reading in
<i>
Ophelia</i>'s life,
</p>
<p>
So oft a Mother, and not once a Wife:
</p>
<p>
She could with just propriety behave,
</p>
<p>
Alive with Peers, with Monarchs in her grave:
</p>
<p>
Her lot how oft have envious harlots wept,
</p>
<p>
By Prebends bury'd and by Generals kept.
</p>
<p class="i2">
T'improve in Morals
<i>
Mandevil
</i>
I read,
</p>
<p>
And
<i>
Tyndal</i>'s Scruples are my settled Creed.
</p>
<p>
I travell'd early, and I soon saw through
</p>
<p>
Religion all, e'er I was twenty-two.
</p>
<p>
Shame, Pain, or Poverty shall I endure,
</p>
<p>
When ropes or opium can my ease procure?
</p>
<p>
When money's gone, and I no debts can pay,
</p>
<p>
Self-murder is an honourable way.
</p>
<p>
As
<i>
Pasaran
</i>
directs I'd end my life,
</p>
<p>
And kill myself, my daughter, and my wife.
</p>
<p>
Burn but that
<i>
Bible
</i>
which the Parson quotes,
</p>
<p>
And men of spirit all shall cut their throats.
</p>
<p class="i2">
But not to writings I confine my pen,
</p>
<p>
I have a taste for buildings, musick, men.
</p>
<p>
Young travell'd coxcombs mighty knowledge boast,
</p>
<p>
With superficial Smatterings at Most.
</p>
<p>
Not so my mind, unsatisfied with hints,
</p>
<p>
Knows more than
<i>
Budgel
</i>
writes, or
<i>
Roberts
</i>
prints.
</p>
<p>
I know the town, all houses I have seen,
</p>
<p>
From
<i>
High-Park
</i>
corner down to
<i>
Bednal-Green</i>.
</p>
<p>
Sure wretched
<i>
Wren
</i>
was taught by bungling
<i>
Jones</i>,
</p>
<p>
To murder mortar, and disfigure stones!
</p>
<p>
Who in
<i>
Whitehall
</i>
can symmetry discern?
</p>
<p>
I reckon
<i>
Convent-garden
</i>
Church a
<i>
Barn</i>.
</p>
<p>
Nor hate I less thy vile Cathedral,
<i>
Paul</i>!
</p>
<p>
The choir's too big, the cupola's too small:
</p>
<p>
Substantial walls and heavy roofs I like,
</p>
<p>
'Tis
<i>
Vanbrug</i>'s structures that my fancy strike:
</p>
<p>
Such noble ruins ev'ry pile wou'd make,
</p>
<p>
I wish they'd tumble for the prospect's sake.
</p>
<p>
To lofty
<i>
Chelsea
</i>
or to
<i>
Greenwich
</i>
Dome,
</p>
<p>
Soldiers and sailors all are welcom'd home.
</p>

Her poor to palaces

Britannia

St.

James</i>'s hospital may serve for kings.
</p>
<p>
Building so happily I understand,
</p>
<p>
That for one house I'd mortgage all my land.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Dorick</i>,
<i>
Ionick</i>, shall not there be found,
</p>
<p>
But it shall cost me threescore thousand pound.
</p>
<p>
From out my honest workmen, I'll select
</p>
<p>
A
<i>
Bricklay'r</i>, and proclaim him architect;
</p>
<p>
First bid him build me a stupendous Dome,
</p>
<p>
Which

having finish'd</i>, we set out for
<i>
Rome</i>;
</p>
<p>
Take a weeks view of
<i>
Venice
</i>
and the
<i>
Brent</i>,
</p>
<p>
Stare round, see nothing, and come home content.
</p>
<p>
I'll have my
<i>
Villa
</i>
too, a sweet abode,
</p>
<p>
Its situation shall be
<i>
London
</i>
road:
</p>
<p>
<i>
Pots

I'll have my Gardens in the fashion too,

<p>
For what is beautiful that is not new?
</p>
<p>
Fair four-legg'd temples, theatres that vye,
</p>
<p>
With all the angles of a
<i>
Christmas</i>-pye.
</p>
<p>
Does it not merit the beholder's praise,
</p>
<p>
What's high to sink? and what is low to raise?
</p>
<p>
Slopes shall ascend where once a green-house stood,
</p>
<p>
And in my horse-pond I will plant a wood.
</p>
<p>
Let misers dread the hoarded gold to waste,
</p>
<p>
Expence and alteration shew a
<i>
Taste</i>.
</p>
<p class="i2">
In curious paintings I'm exceeding nice,
</p>
<p>
And know their several beauties by their

Price</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Auctions

<p>
Originals and copies much the same,

My taste in Sculpture from my choice is seen,

I buy no statues that are not obscene.

In spite of

<p>
Sir

Cloudesly Shovel</i>'s is my fav'rite tomb.
</p>
<p>
How oft have I with admiration stood,

<p>
To view some City-magistrate in wood?
</p>
<p>
I gaze with pleasure on a Lord May'r's head,
</p>
<p>
Cast with propriety in gilded lead.
</p>
<p>
Oh could I view through

London

Some broad Sir

Corinthian

<p>
High on a pedestal, ye Freemen, place

His magisterial Paunch and griping Face;
</p>
<p>

Letter'd and Gilt</i>, let him adorn

</p>
<p>
And therefore proper at a Sheriff's feast.
</p>
<p>
My soul has oft a secret pleasure found,

<p>
In the harmonious Bagpipe's lofty sound.

Bagpipes for men, shrill

privilege
</i>
of
<i>
Peer
</i>
procure,
</p>
<p>
The rich I'd bully, and oppress the poor.
</p>
<p>
To
<i>
give
</i>
is wrong, but it is wronger still,
</p>
<p>
On any terms to
<i>
pay
</i>
a tradesman's bill.
</p>
<p>
I'd make the insolent Mechanicks stay,
</p>
<p>
And keep my ready money all for
<i>
play</i>.
</p>
<p>
I'd try if any pleasure could be found,
</p>
<p>
In
<i>
tossing-up
</i>
for twenty thousand pound.
</p>
<p>
Had I whole Counties, I to
<i>
White</i>'s would go,
</p>
<p>
And set lands, woods, and rivers, at a throw.
</p>
<p>
But should I meet with an unlucky run,
</p>
<p>
And at a throw be gloriously undone;
</p>
<p>
My
<i>
debts of honour
</i>
I'd discharge the first,
</p>
<p>
Let all my
<i>
lawful creditors
</i>
be curst:
</p>
<p>
My
<i>
Title
</i>
would preserve me from arrest,
</p>
<p>
And seising
<i>
hired horses
</i>
is a jest.
</p>
<p>
I'd walk the mornings with an
<i>
oaken stick</i>,
</p>
<p>
With gloves and hat, like my own
<i>
footman, Dick</i>.
</p>
<p>
A footman I wou'd be, in outward show,
</p>
<p>
In sense, and education,
<i>
truly so</i>.
</p>
<p>
As for my
<i>
head</i>, it should ambiguous wear
</p>
<p>
<i>
At once
</i>
a periwig,
<i>
and
</i>
its own hair.
</p>
<p>
My hair I'd powder in the women's way,
</p>
<p>
And
<i>
dress</i>, and
<i>
talk of dressing</i>, more than they.
</p>
<p>
I'll please the maids of honour, if I can;
</p>
<p>
Without black-velvet-britches, what is man?
</p>
<p>
I will my skill in
<i>
button-holes
</i>
display,
</p>
<p>
And brag how oft I shift me ev'ry day.
</p>
<p>
Shall I wear cloaths, in
<i>
awkward England
</i>
made?
</p>
<p>
And sweat in cloth, to help the
<i>
woollen trade</i>?
</p>
<p>
In
<i>
French
</i>
embroid'ry and in
<i>
Flanders
</i>
lace
</p>
<p>
I'll spend the income of a treasurer's place.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Deard</i>'s bill for baubles shall to thousands mount,
</p>
<p>
And I'd out-di'mond ev'n the
<i>
Di'mond Count</i>.
</p>
<p>
I would convince the world by taudry cloa's,
</p>
<p>
That
<i>
Belles
</i>
are less effeminate than beaux,
</p>
<p>
And Doctor
<i>
Lamb
</i>
should pare my Lordship's toes.
</p>
<p class="i2">
To boon companions I my time would give,
</p>
<p>
With players, pimps, and parasites I'd live.
</p>
<p>
I would with
<i>
Jockeys
</i>
from
<i>
Newmarket
</i>
dine,
</p>
<p>
And to
<i>
Rough-riders
</i>
give my choicest wine.
</p>
<p>
I would caress some
<i>
Stableman
</i>
of note,
</p>
<p>
And imitate his language, and his
<i>
coat</i>.
</p>
<p>
My ev'nings all I would with
<i>
sharpers
</i>
spend,
</p>
<p>
And make the
<i>
Thief-catcher
</i>
my bosom friend.
</p>
<p>
In
<i>
Fig
</i>
the Prize-fighter by day delight,
</p>
<p>
And sup with
<i>
Colly Cibber
</i>
ev'ry night.
</p>
<p class="i2">
Should I perchance be fashionably ill,
</p>
<p>
I'd send for
<i>
Misaubin</i>, and take his pill.
</p>
<p>
I should abhor, though in the utmost need,
</p>
<p>
<i>
Arbuthnot</i>,
<i>
Hollins</i>,
<i>
Wigan</i>,
<i>
Lee</i>, or
<i>
Mead</i>:
</p>
<p>
But if I found that I grew worse and worse,
</p>
<p>
I'd turn off
<i>
Misaubin
</i>
and take a Nurse.
</p>
<p>
How oft, when eminent physicians fail,
</p>
<p>
Do good old womens remedies prevail?
</p>
<p>
When beauty's gone, and
<i>
Chloe</i>'s struck with years,
</p>
<p>
Eyes she can couch, or she can syringe ears.
</p>
<p>
Of Graduates I dislike the learned rout,
</p>
<p>
And chuse a
<i>
female Doctor
</i>
for the gout.
</p>
<p class="i2">
Thus would I live, with no dull
<i>
pedants
</i>
curs'd,
</p>
<p>
Sure, of all blockheads,
<i>
Scholars
</i>
are the worst.
</p>
<p>
Back to your
<i>
Universitys</i>, ye fools,
</p>
<p>
And dangle Arguments on strings in schools:
</p>
<p>
Those schools which
<i>
Universitys
</i>
they call,
</p>
<p>
'Twere well for
<i>
England
</i>
were there none at all.
</p>
<p>
With ease that loss the nation might sustain,
</p>
<p>
Supply'd by
<i>
Goodman's Fields
</i>
and
<i>
Drury-lane</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Oxford
</i>
and
<i>
Cambridge
</i>
are not worth one farthing,
</p>
<p>
Compar'd to
<i>
Haymarket</i>, and
<i>
Convent-garden</i>:
</p>
<p>
Quit those, ye British Youth, and follow these,
</p>
<p>
Turn players all, and take your 'Squires degrees.
</p>
<p>
Boast not your incomes now, as heretofore,
</p>
<p>
Ye book-learn'd Seats! the Theatres have more:
</p>
<p>
Ye stiff-rump'd heads of Colleges be dumb,
</p>
<p>
A singing Eunuch gets a larger Sum.
</p>
<p>
Have some of you three hundred by the Year,
</p>
<p>
<i>
Booth</i>,
<i>
Rich</i>, and
<i>
Cibber</i>, twice three thousand clear.
</p>
<p>
Should
<i>
Oxford
</i>
to her sister
<i>
Cambridge
</i>
join
</p>
<p>
A Year's
<i>
Rack-rent</i>, and
<i>
Arbitrary fine</i>:
</p>
<p>
Thence not one winter's charge would be defray'd,
</p>
<p>
For Playhouse, Opera, Ball, and Masquerade.
</p>
<p>
Glad I congratulate the judging Age,
</p>
<p>
The players are the world, the world the stage.
</p>
<p class="i2">
I am a Politician too, and hate
</p>
<p>
Of any party, ministers of state:
</p>
<p>
I'm for an
<i>
Act</i>, that he, who sev'n whole Years
</p>
<p>
Has serv'd his
<i>
King
</i>
and
<i>
Country</i>, lose his ears.
</p>
<p class="i2">
Thus from my birth I'm qualified you find,
</p>
<p>
To give the laws of
<i>
Taste
</i>
to humane kind.
</p>
<p>
Mine are the gallant Schemes of Politesse,
</p>
<p>
For books, and buildings, politicks, and dress.
</p>
<p>
This is
<i>
True Taste</i>, and whoso likes it not,
</p>
<p>
Is blockhead, coxcomb, puppy, fool, and sot.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
